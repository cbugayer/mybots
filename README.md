Artificial Life Final Project

This project has its roots in https://www.reddit.com/r/ludobots. It is built on pybullet and pyrosim. It allows one to create robots in a simulation and evolve them with a fitness function. 

The way to run the simulation is to run `python search.py` in your terminal.

## Hypothesis 
I thought the control group would do better than the experimental group. My thought process was, how could a creature whose body is constantly changing evolve as well as a creature with a constant body?

## Results
I found that it didn't make a difference in the early stage of evolution whether or not link shapes stayed constant or not. I was unable to run my simulation for more than the amount of generations shown because multiple times my terminal crashed hours into the simulation.
