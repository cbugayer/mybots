Artificial Life Assignments 1 - 7

This project has its roots in https://www.reddit.com/r/ludobots. It is built on pybullet and pyrosim. It allows one to create robots in a simulation and evolve them with a fitness function. 

The way to run the simulation is to run `python search.py` in your terminal.
